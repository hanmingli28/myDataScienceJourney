                <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
                    <p>Wildfire has been one of the worst and destructive and devastating natural disasters in the US, which often occur during the summer season on the west coast. A massive wildfire could burn through hundreds of thousands of acres, destroying everything along its way. According the World Health Organization, wildfire can "disrupt transportation, communications, power and gas services, and water supply. They also lead to a deterioration of the air quality, and loss of property, crops, resources, animals and people. Not only does wildfire pose great danger and risks to both lives and properties, it also expedites global warming as it releases tons of carbon dioxide – a key greenhouse gas. Hence, the topic of wildfire and its impact is definitely something worth studying.</p><br>
                
                <p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>
                    <p>I decided to focus on the topic of wildfire because I have personal experience with wildfire during my freshman year in college, and it was something I could not easily forget. The wildfire is called Thomas fire, and it started on December 4, 2017, reported by a nearby resident to the north of Santa Paula. It started a small bush fire, but it exploded in size and raced through the mountain terrain in just a few days. It took the fire just 6 days to reach Santa Barbara counties, where I was staying. The Thomas fire once gotten so close to my university campus to a point that half of the sky became red at night. And the ashes floating in the air was so heavy that it could build up a thick layer on the bike seat if you leave it outside for merely the time of one lesson. Due to the terrible air quality as well as the potential danger posed by Thomas fire, the finals of that quarter were postponed until the start of the next quarter, which circumstance was rarely seen. Afterall, the impact on school works was no big deal compared to those who lost their homes or almost lost their lives.</p>
                    
                    <p>I later read in the news that Thomas fire burned approximately 30,000 acres before being fully contained on January 12, 2018, making it officially the largest wildfire in modern California history at the time. According to statistics, it destroyed at least 1000 structures, while damaging nearly 300 others. And it caused a total of over $2.2 billion in damages. A total of 23 people were killed either directly or indirectly, including 1 firefighter and 22 civilians. All those numbers are painful to watch, which is why I was eager to use the toolbox of data science to look into this pressing issue.</p><br>
                    
                <p><strong>Wildfire Trends and Impact</strong></p>
                    <p>Wildfires can happen in many places in the United States, especially during droughts, but are most common in the Western United States and Florida. As of Nov. 5, the National Interagency Fire Center’s (NIFC) reported a total of 48,725 wildfires across the country that had burned over 6.5 million acres. There were 749 personnel deployed on 11 large, active fires across the U.S., of these, five were uncontained. The average year-to-date was 51,028 fires burning 6.97 million acres.</p>
                    
                    <p>Over the past several decades, wildfire activity, damages attributed to wildfires, and costs of managing wildfires have increased substantially in the United States. While the average annual number of fire ignitions in the US declined by approximately 780 fires per year between 1991 and 2020, the annual area burned in fires increased by roughly 192,000 acres per year during the same time period. Areas burned in wildfires increased particularly sharply in the western United States, where the annual average area burned in large forest fires grew by about 1200 percent between the 1970s and the 2000s. Three of the top five years for burned acreage in the United States since 1960 have occurred since 2015.</p>
                    
                    <p>With recent increases in wildfire activity have come an increase in damages due to wildfire. The prevalence of wildfire smoke has increased substantially since the mid-2000s, and wildfires now cause approximately 25 percent of Americans’ total exposure to harmful fine particulate matter known as PM2.5. Smoke exposure—which can affect many people as wildfire smoke spreads across a wide area—can cause and exacerbate health problems.</p><br>
                
                <p><strong>Possible Causes of Wildfire</strong></p>
                    <p>According to the Insurance Information Institute, as many as 90 percent of wildland fires in the United States are caused by people (U.S. Department of Interior). Some human-caused fires result from campfires left unattended, the burning of debris, downed power lines, negligently discarded cigarettes and intentional acts of arson. The remaining 10 percent are started by lightning or lava. </p>
                    
                    <p>However, although sometimes the fire was not started directly by people, the increasing frequency and the ability to spread rapid are definitely due to human activity. Due to climate change, which is largely accelerated by human activity, fire seasons around the world have grown longer. In the United States, fire seasons in western states have been especially affected. More specifically, the higher temperature and droughts driven by global warming are really becoming a concern, and there has been increased advocacy for controlled burns and other measures to prevent fuel from accumulating in wild areas that can create more intense, larger, and difficult to control fires.</p>
